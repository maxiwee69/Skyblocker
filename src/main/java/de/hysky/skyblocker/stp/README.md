# Skyblocker Texture Predicates Documentation/Specification

Skyblocker Texture Predicates or "STP" is our high-performance custom texturing system which is based upon the vanilla predicates format with some notable extensions, the system is packed full of a bunch of different predicates to cover a wide variety of use-cases and maintains a consistent design for retexturing different things (e.g. items, armor, blocks); the system is also active Hypixel-wide allowing for retexturing things for other games as well.

## Advantages
Compared to the OptiFine format, our format integrates perfectly with the vanilla system and offers a wide variety of specialized predicates for different needs for texture pack authors. Skyblocker is very well maintained and updates to new versions on the day of their release (which usually contain new texture pack features) so authors won't need to wait on OptiFine/CITR which have historically been a little behind on their update game. Skyblocker is very well known and has a very large user base for the modern versions meaning that the vast majority of player's clients on these versions have support for our format.<br><br>

Our specialized predicates for item ids, and pet info for example enable added resiliency against changes in the game and on Hypixel (e.g. components broke everything), it also means that we can provide a fast path for common scenarios.

## Predicates
Predicates are evaluated in the order in which they are defined, so if one predicate needs to take on a higher priority than another it should be specified first. All predicates specified for a *[model override](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Model#Item_models)* must return true in order for that model to be used, see section on logical predicates if that functionality is undesirable. If you want to specify multiple of one predicate then logical predicates will serve your use case.

### Data Predicates
"Data" predicates are predicates which match upon some kind of item data, like the Skyblock item id, an item's custom data, or string/regex matching.<br>

| Predicate Id                   | Type   | Description                                                                    | Since  |
|--------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| skyblocker:item_id             | String | Exact match for a Skyblock Item ID.                                            | 1.22.0 |
| skyblocker:custom_data         | SNBT   | Looks for a match on an item's custom data.                                    | 1.22.0 |
| skyblocker:location            | String | Matches for a Skyblock location.                                               | 1.22.0 |
| skyblocker:regex               | Object | Allows for a full or partial regex match on an item's lore, name, or texture.  | 1.22.0 |
| skyblocker:string              | Object | Allows for a full or partial string match on an item's lore or name.           | 1.22.0 |
| skyblocker:pet_info            | Object | Allows for matching a to a pet type, tier, or skin.                            | 1.22.0 |
| skyblocker:bounding_box        | Object | Allows for matching whether the player is inside of a box.                     | 1.22.0 |
| skyblocker:profile_component   | Object | Allows for matching to a profile component's uuid.                             | 1.22.0 |
| skyblocker:held_by_armor_stand | Bool   | Allows for testing whether the ItemStack is held by an armor stand.            | 1.22.0 |

*Note:* The only predicates here that do not require an `ItemStack` are the `location`, and `bounding_box` predicates. All other predicates listed here require an `ItemStack` which means that they can only be tested in scenarios where an `ItemStack` is available. Any predicate that doesn't match this criteria can be used in any place, meanwhile the predicates that do require an `ItemStack` can only be used in item and armor re-texturing.

#### Examples
```json
"predicate": {
	"skyblocker:item_id": "ASTRAEA"
}
```
```json
"predicate": {
	"skyblocker:custom_data": "{\"gems\":{\"JASPER_0\":{\"quality\":\"PERFECT\"}}}"
}
```
```json
"predicate": {
	"skyblocker:location": "dynamic" //Private Island
}
```
```json
"predicate": {
	"skyblocker:regex": {
		"matchType": "FULL", //FULL or PARTIAL
		"target": "NAME", //NAME, LORE, or TEXTURE - Note: TEXTURE is only valid for player heads and allows matching on the texture base64.
		"regex": "<some regex>" //Any regex, most should be supported by Java
	}
}
```
```json
"predicate": {
	"skyblocker:string": {
		"matchType": "EQUALS", //EQUALS, CONTAINS, STARTS_WITH, or ENDS_WITH
		"target": "NAME", //NAME, LORE, or TEXTURE - Note: TEXTURE is only valid for player heads and allows matching on the texture base64.
		"string": "<some string>" //The string to match against
	}
}
```
```json
"predicate": {
	"skyblocker:pet_info": { //Requires that the equivalent pet info field's value match the value you specify here. All fields specified will require a match, if you don't care about the tier field for example then do not include it.
		"type": "GOLDEN_DRAGON", //Optional Field
		"tier": "LEGENDARY", //Optional Field
		"skin": "RABBIT_AQUAMARINE" //Optional Field - the pet skin id without the PET_SKIN_ prefix
	}
}
```
```json
"predicate": {
	"skyblocker:bounding_box": { //This predicate automatically determines the min/max coordinates from the two positions while checking whether the player is inside of the defined box.
		"pos1": [
			127, //X
			175, //Y
			183  //Z
		],
		"pos2": [
			-129, //X
			111,  //Y
			480   //Z
		]
	}
}
```
```json
"predicate": {
	"skyblocker:profile_component": {
		"uuid": "cf05e314-fa88-4b01-b963-77961375a86a" //Matches to a profile component's id parameter - used for player head textures. UUID must have dashes.
	}
}
```
```json
"predicate": {
	"skyblocker:held_by_armor_stand": true //Requires that this ItemStack instance be held by an armor stand.
}
```

### Logical Predicates
"Logical" predicates perform logical operations on *other* predicates, for example say you want to override a texture when it's Skyblock Item ID is either `POWER_WITHER_CHESTPLATE` or `POWER_WITHER_LEGGINGS`, due to the default behavior requiring a match for all specified predicates these overrides would need to be defined separately despite doing the same thing; logical predicates solve this issue by allowing you to perform "OR"s, "AND"s, or "NOT"s on a list of predicates.<br>

| Predicate ID   | Type           | Description                                           | Since  |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| skyblocker:or  | Predicate List | Performs a Logical OR on all predicates in the list.  | 1.22.0 |
| skyblocker:and | Predicate List | Performs a Logical AND on all predicates in the list. | 1.22.0 |
| skyblocker:not | Predicate List | Performs a Logical NOT on all predicates in the list. | 1.22.0 |

*Note:* While all logical predicates operate independently of an `ItemStack`, if you're using them in a context where an `ItemStack` is unavailable (such as with Custom Block Re-texturing) then all predicates included in the list should not require an `ItemStack`. Going against this may lead to **undefined behavior** such as game crashes, you have been warned!<br><br>

When using a logical predicate, regular predicates must all be specified in an `Object` format with an `id` field representing the predicate's id. For predicates which are objects, the predicate's fields are simply specified normally alongside the predicate id field. For predicates which *are not* objects, their value must be specificed in a field named colloquially as `value`. The Logical AND, OR, and NOT predicates use the same format for listing predicates, see some examples below:

#### Examples
Say you wanted to perform a Logical OR on two `item_id` predicates, you can do this by:<br>

```json
"predicate": {
	"skyblocker:or": [ //This predicate will return true if any one of these predicates evaluate to true
		{
			"id": "skyblocker:item_id",
			"value": "POWER_WITHER_HELMET"
		},
		{
			"id": "skyblocker:item_id",
			"value": "POWER_WITHER_CHESTPLATE"
		}
	]
}
```
If you wanted to perform a Logical AND on an item's id and name, this can be done with:<br>

```json
"predicate": {
	"skyblocker:and": [
		 {
			"id": "skyblocker:item_id",
			"value": "DARK_CLAYMORE"
		},
		{
			"id": "skyblocker:string",
			"matchType": "CONTAINS",
			"target": "NAME",
			"string": "Withered"
		}
	]
}
```
If you want to check whether a predicate or multiple predicates are false you can do this with the Logical NOT predicate like so:<br>

```json
"predicate": {
	"skyblocker:not": [ //Returns true if the item id is not HYPERION
		{
			"id": "skyblocker:item_id",
			"value": "HYPERION"
		}
	]
}
```

#### Notes
Logical predicates can also be nested inside of eachother!

## Item Re-texturing
Item re-texturing is done through the vanilla predicate and model system which is also what the Custom Model Data system uses, so its expected that you have a basic understanding of that system before using ours. Item model overrides using our predicates can either be specified alongside their vanilla model or in a separate directory (see below).

### Vanilla Model File Example
This model file for the `diamond_sword` item will override the vanilla model for a diamond sword when the item's id is `ASPECT_OF_THE_DRAGON`.<br>

```json
{
	"parent": "item/handheld",
	"textures": {
		"layer0": "item/diamond_sword"
	},
	"overrides": [
		{
			"predicate": {
				"skyblocker:item_id": "ASPECT_OF_THE_DRAGON"
			},
			"model": "item/aspect_of_the_dragons" //Model file path
		}
	]
}
```
### Separate Directory Model Overrides Example
If you have a lot of model overrides for a certain item then packing them all into one model file could cause it to get a bit too large, for this purpose we support loading model overrides from the `assets/skyblocker/overrides/item` directory. Inside of that directory you are free to use subfolders for further organization as well. The name of the file doesn't matter and is up to you.<br><br>

The `parent` field is the name of the vanilla model file where the `overrides` will be injected into at runtime, the parent name should be the file name of the vanilla model without the `.json` extension.

```json
{
    "parent": "iron_sword",
	"overrides": [
		{
			"predicate":{
				"skyblocker:item_id": "VALKYRIE"
			},
			"model": "item/valkyrie" //Model file path
		}
	]
}
```
### Notes
As expected you will need to define a model file for your custom item, this model file goes into the `assets/minecraft/models/item` directory (you can also put your custom model files in subdirectories inside of that folder), here is an example:<br>

```json
{
	"parent": "item/handheld",
	"textures": {
		 "layer0": "item/valkyrie" //Path to the item texture in the textures folder
	}
}
```

## Armor Re-texturing
With Armor re-texturing you specify which armor layers you want to be used when the specified overrides (and predicates) match. You're also able to use a specific layer for an override avoiding the need to put more specific armor texture overrides for the same set in different files and hope that the load order is sufficient enough for it to work out. All overrides must be specified in the `assets/skyblocker/overrides/armor` folder, using subdirectories inside of there is also supported. The name of the file is up to you and doesn't matter.<br><br>

Skyblocker also supports **re-texturing player heads** via this system!

### Layers
For each armour layer you specify a namespaced `id` for it, optionally its `suffix`, and optionally whether the layer should be `dyeable` which is whether its affected by the armor's current vanilla dye color (if applied). Armor texture paths are resolved in this format: `assets/<namespace>/textures/models/armor/<path>_layer_(isSecondLayer ? 2 : 1)<suffix>.png` (the namespace and path come from the `id`), its recommended to either use Skyblocker's namespace or your own.

### Examples

#### Basic Override Example
Say you wanted to provide a custom texture for Storm armor, an example file would look like:<br>

```json
{
	"layers": [
		{
			"id": "skyblocker:wise_wither",
			"suffix": "",
			"dyeable": false
		},
		{
			"id": "skyblocker:wise_wither",
			"suffix": "_overlay",
			"dyeable": false
		}
	],
	"overrides": [
		{
			"predicate": {
				"skyblocker:or": [
					{
						"id": "skyblocker:item_id",
						"value": "WISE_WITHER_HELMET"
					},
					{
						"id": "skyblocker:item_id",
						"value": "WISE_WITHER_CHESTPLATE"
					},
					{
						"id": "skyblocker:item_id",
						"value": "WISE_WITHER_LEGGINGS"
					},
					{
						"id": "skyblocker:item_id",
						"value": "WISE_WITHER_BOOTS"
					}
				]
			}
		}
	]
}
```
Note that the textures will need to be placed as `assets/skyblocker/textures/models/armor/wise_wither_layer_1.png` and `assets/skyblocker/textures/models/armor/wise_wither_layer_1_overlay.png`.

#### Advanced Override
Say you wanted to provide a custom texture for a Necron Chestplate/Boots, but also use a different texture for the chestplate while in dungeons. This can be achieved by:<br>

```json
{
	"layers": [
		{
			"id": "power_wither",
			"suffix": "",
			"dyeable": false
		},
		{
			"id": "power_wither",
			"suffix": "_overlay",
			"dyeable": false
		}
	],
	"overrides": [
		{
			"predicate": {
				"skyblocker:item_id": "POWER_WITHER_CHESTPLATE",
				"skyblocker:location": "dungeon"
			},
			"layers": [
				{
					"id": "power_wither_dungeon",
					"suffix": "",
					"dyeable": false
				},
				{
					"id": "power_wither_dungeon",
					"suffix": "_overlay",
					"dyeable": false
				}
			]
		},
		{
			"predicate": {
				"skyblocker:or": [
					{
						"id": "skyblocker:item_id",
						"value": "POWER_WITHER_CHESTPLATE"
					},
					{
						"id": "skyblocker:item_id",
						"value": "POWER_WITHER_BOOTS"
					}
				]
			}
		}
	]
}
```

### Notes about armor re-texturing
For maintaining a high performance system, all armor textures are cached per `ItemStack` instance for at least 5 minutes. The cache is cleared upon Hypixel sending a new instance of the item or when textures are reloaded.<br><br>

## Block re-texturing/re-modelling
Yes you heard that correctly, Skyblocker supports re-texturing block's based on predicates! With custom block re-texturing you are able to conditionally replace a block's model with your own custom one using the exact same JSON model files that you would use to achieve the same effect with vanilla blocks, you have total control over how your customized blocks will appear and be modelled.<br>

### Model Files
Custom block model files are like regular block model files, just for your own blocks; you can use any feature in them that vanilla supports. The only difference is where you need to place your model files, they must go under the `assets/skyblocker/models/block` directory. As usual we also support placing your model files inside of sub-directories there, and you can name them whatever you want although you will need to reference the path to them in your custom blocks definition file.<br><br>

Here's an example of a model file where the block has the same texture on all six sides:

```json
{
	"parent": "minecraft:block/cube_all",
	"textures": {
		"all": "minecraft:block/glacite"
	}
}
```

### Custom Block Override Files
Custom block override files are specified in the `assets/skyblocker/overrides/block` directory. Their name doesn't matter however Skyblocker will try to infer a `location` predicate from it, e.g. if you have the file name as `mining_3` then Skyblocker will automatically attach a location predicate that matches to the Dwarven Mines to each override in the file.<br><br>

In each file you can specify multiple overrides, for each you must specify a `Map` of replacement block ids to block models, and you also specify any predicates you want to match to for in order for said custom block overrides to be active. You can optionally also specify a `name` however it is ignored by the override loader is never logged or exposed in any way, its purely for making sense of each override in a file. Note that the only predicates supported for custom block overrides are predicates that **do not** rely on an `ItemStack` being present, see documentation above for predicates which fulfill this requirement.<br><br>

Here is an example of a block override file that will override light blue wool when in the dwarven mines, and an override that will also replace the packed ice in the Glacite Tunnels with a custom glacite block:

```json
[
	{
		"name": "Dwarven Mines",
		"replacements": {
			"minecraft:light_blue_wool": "block/mithril" //Points to the model file in skyblocker/models/block. If using subdirectories then those paths must also be specified.
		},
		"predicate": {
			"skyblocker:not": [ //Exclude this rule from being active inside of the Glacite Tunnels
				{
					"id": "skyblocker:bounding_box",
					"pos1": [
						127,
						175,
						183
					],
					"pos2": [
						-129,
						111,
						480
					]
				}
			]
		}
	},
	{
		"name": "Glacite Tunnels",
		"replacements": {
			"minecraft:light_blue_wool": "block/mithril",
			"minecraft:packed_ice": "block/glacite"
		},
		"predicate": {
			"skyblocker:bounding_box": { //Enable when in the Glacite Tunnels
				"pos1": [
					127,
					175,
					183
				],
				"pos2": [
					-129,
					111,
					480
				]
			}
		}
	}
]
```
*Note:* Since this file is named `mining_3.json` the Dwarven Mines location predicate is automatically inferred for all overrides.

### Special Functionality
When available, the position tested on the `bounding_box` predicate may be the location of a block that matched the `replacements` provided. In any case regardless of whether its a block position or the player's current position being tested the results should remain the same provided that the defined boxes are sensible.

## Conclusion
Enjoy re-texturing to your heart's content! We plan on adding far more powerful re-texturing features very very soon. If you have any requests let us know and we will add it to our TODO list and get it done!
